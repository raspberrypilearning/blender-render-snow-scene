## Check your animation

For this project you will need the animation you created with the [Animate a snow scene](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/blender-animate-snow-scene){:target="_blank"} resource. If you have not completed this resource, you can download and use the [starter snow scene](resources/starter-snow-scene.blend){:target="_blank"} instead.

Play your animation by clicking the **Play** icon or by moving the bar on the timeline at the bottom of the screen. Do you like how it looks?
