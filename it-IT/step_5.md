The computer is now creating hundreds of single images, then stitching them all together to make the film. For each step on the timeline, the computer will have to create one image, in this case 24 images (frames) per second.

You'll notice that the resolution is not high: if you zoom in, you can see the pixels. If you had chosen HD or 4K rendering settings, the resolution of the video would be much better, but your computer would need much more time to render it.

Once the render has finished, go to the folder where you have stored the file. You should see the file of your four-second-long movie.

+ Now play your movie!
